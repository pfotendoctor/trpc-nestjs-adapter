# Example

This folder is meant to be an example of how to ues `trpc-nestjs-adapter` in your codebase.

Not that you can't just copy-paste this out of this repo and into yours. At the moment, use it  as more of an inspiration. 

If/When/As the package gains traction I'll improve the example & related docs.
